## GAME OF DICE PROJECT

## WORKING

# This is a working demonstrable project covering almost al lthe test cases I could think of as per the requirement sheet.
# To execute this program please run DiceGame.java's main method of this project. (IntelliJ set up preferred)
# Once in it will ask you for multiple options like 1. start new game, 2 . Play a round, 3, Exit
# For first time please select option 1 after which you will be promted to enter number of players whose playing order will be decided in random fashion.
# On completing this you will be asked for a threshold score to decide for a winner. Enter the limit.
# After that select option 2 by pressing 2(play round).
# In the rounds for n players press 'r' to roll dice for each player.
# after every round a score or standing of all players will be displayed.
# lets say if one player completes the round by reaching to threshold score then in that case he wont be playing next rounds and those rounds will take place among current users and scores for that round will be limited only to applicable player. Plaer who won will be also diplayed as part of final result after all rounds.
# Please refer to the comments in the code. If still not clear then let me know.
